## 🛠️ Optimization Stack

### 1. Algorithmic: Pre-Normalization Strategy
Instead of calculating correlation for every pair using the standard $O(N^2)$ formula, we pre-normalize the entire matrix ($mean=0$, $std\_dev=1$).
* **Impact:** Reduces the core correlation logic to a simple **Dot Product**, significantly lowering the number of operations inside the hot loop.

### 2. Parallelism: OpenMP Orchestration
* **Nested Loop Collapsing:** Used `#pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)` to flatten the triangular iteration space, providing a larger pool of work for threads.
* **Dynamic Load Balancing:** Implemented `schedule(dynamic)` to handle the decreasing workload of the lower triangular matrix, ensuring no thread remains idle.

### 3. Hardware-Level: SIMD & Cache Tuning
* **SIMD Vectorization:** Leveraged `#pragma omp simd` to enable AVX/AVX2 instruction sets for the dot product calculations.
* **Cache Locality:** Optimized memory access patterns using row-major traversal to maximize L1/L2 cache hit rates.

## 📊 Deep-Dive Analysis

### The 4-Thread "Sweet Spot"
As a Bachelor of Engineering student at Thapar, it's critical to note the hardware-software ceiling. While the system reports 8 logical cores, peak efficiency was reached at **4 threads**.

* **Observation:** Scaling is near-linear up to 4 threads ($93.4\%$ efficiency).
* **Bottleneck:** At 8 threads, performance degrades to $31.7\%$ efficiency. This suggests **Memory Bandwidth Saturation** and contention between Hyper-Threads (SMT) sharing execution units.
